Command line program to extra data from the game Icarus: First Cohort. This is mainly just for my own use to update data each week when the game updates.

## Usage

Run the program with no parameters to print the usage.
```
IcarusDataMiner [game content directory] [output directory] [[optional comma separated list of miners to run, else all will run]]
```

## Releases

There are no releases of this tool for the time being. If you wish to try it, you will need to build it.

## Building

Clone the repository, including submodules.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/CrystalFerrai/IcarusDataMiner.git
```

You can then open and build Ue4Export.sln.
